## Context

Feedzai is a place where the best engineers get a continuous stream of complex challenges to identify and solve. 

## Details

We will be looking for the most genius solutions for solving challenging problems. We won't give you a specific problem, you can even win two challenges with the same project. 

The jury will be looking for the complexity of the problem solved as well as the elegance and simplicity of the solution. The viability of the idea to become a real-world solution as well as doing proper usage of the technologies involved will be also valued.
