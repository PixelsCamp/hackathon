## Context

Every day ~~dozens~~ hundreds of new and old candidates alike are applying to tech positions through the Landing.jobs platform. 

Identifying who these people are beforehand would enable Landing.jobs to:

 * Know who are the candidates likeliest to apply in the near future and instigate that action to happen (e.g. through email messaging);

 * Perform candidate supply prediction, to know how many candidates are applying to each company and act accordingly (e.g. direct supply to positions underperforming).

The first step in this is trying to predict who applies tomorrow! From the profile of candidates, companies and their platform behaviours, figure out whoâ€™s applying.
