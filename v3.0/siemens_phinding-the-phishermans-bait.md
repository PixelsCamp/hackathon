## Context

**Can you distinguish between legitimate emails and phishing ones?**

Email phishing is one of the most classic problems in Cyber Security and yet, it still prevails as one of the most used attacks by cybercriminals. The number of attacks is also growing. According to RSA monthly online fraud report [1]. In 2014, 500K phishing incidents were reported, followed by 750K in 2015, and 900K in 2016. By leveraging social engineering techniques, attackers lure their victims into clicking in some malicious URL or attachment. For example, phishers send out spoofed emails that look as if they had been sent by trusted companies exploiting users’ inability to distinguish between legitimate information/sources from fake ones. Despite being a simple method, it imposes a challenge for most organizations. 

## Details

A modern example of this type of attacks and its damage is the “John Podesta’s hack”, former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chairman. His Gmail account was “hacked” in March 2016 prior to the US election. The email requested Podesta to change his account password by clicking in a link. However, the link didn’t open a secure Google web page, instead directing the user blindly via bit.ly (a service used to shorten URLs). Podesta hack didn’t require much technical skills. The simplicity of the attack, of course, does not make it less dangerous.

In the other trench, organizations try to develop solutions to respond against phishing threats. Phishing awareness trainings are one way. However, not enough, even Cyber Professionals may bite the bait.

Therefore, we welcome your help in hunting this old and vigorous threat. The challenge is to develop an approach which can:

 - detect phishing emails

 - group phishing emails into phishing campaigns (the big picture)


PS: don’t trick yourself. Detecting spam is not the same as detecting phishing [2]. The former is indeed annoying, but harmless (well, if you consider filling your email box harmless :D ), while detecting the latter is where you find the $$$.

* B - If you are lost but you are considering it, below you have a couple of options to help you start. However, don't consider this "THE way to go". We are truly interested in your creativity and out-side-of-the-box thinking!
 
If you are reading this, you acknowledge that you want to go with B despite the risks mentioned in A!
 
Ok, so to speed you up, we have listed below a couple of data sources (websites) where you can find data to use in phishing email detection task. There is also data about phishing websites, in case you want to look at the problem from a different angle. Nevertheless, we encourage you to find more data sources or anything that can help. Feel free to innovate.
