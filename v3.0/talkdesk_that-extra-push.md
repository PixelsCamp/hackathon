## That extra push

## Context

Talkdesk started at an hackathon. We get you! 
Our challenge is simple, we're giving you access to talkdesk and asking you to build an even better project.

## Details

We're giving you access to a talkdesk account loaded with some credits and some of early access features we're releasing. 
Talkdesk allows you to easily handle user contacts, both automatically with calls to your own APIs and personally for that special touch.
Talk to our mentors to get access and tips on how to use Talkdesk Studio to build your idea.
