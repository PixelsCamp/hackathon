## Context

The Tourism sector, in addition to being in fast growing and expansion, presents interesting challenges for Digital Transformation, increasingly enhanced by the power of Analytics.

## Details

This challenge requires you to create an app that will guide visitors and locals to places of their interest, while on the move.

Simulate subscriber movements: for each movement data point you have to look for points of interest locations (like museums, cultural events, etc..) with tourism potential and day to day services (restaurants, parking, etc..) a subscriber would use. These subscribers may be foreign visitors and/ or domestic tourists.

The app has to collect the subscriber coordinates as the subscriber moves around. It also has to collect basic user data, to enable you to customize the offer, like age group, gender, presence of kids - which are filled in by the subscriber in exchange of an incentive (e.g., 1GB of data or 5 EUR of discount on petrol). The app should have a QR Code generator for the subscriber to use when redeeming an incentive or any suggested visit or offer they choose to do/ take.

Off to work now - surprise us!
