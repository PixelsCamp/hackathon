![Social Responsibility Mission Market](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/hackathon/master/v3.0/assets/worten_social-responsibility-mission-market.jpg "Social Responsibility Mission Market")

## Context

We want to empower our employees all over Portugal and Spain and Nonprofit Organizations to suggest, promote and engage with meaningful challenges concerning several aspects of society, whether economic, social, environmental, and/or any other they consider important.

Therefore, we want to ask you to take part in developing a “Social Responsibility Mission Market”, where Organizations can be invited by Worten or suggested by employees to join and place and promote their actions/missions. All Worten community can as volunteers, individually or in a team with other people, contribute with donations, time or ideas.

Every volunteer will have a score for each mission he engages in, given by the organization. The top scored employees will receive vouchers, that they can donate back to meaningful causes chosen by them.


## Details

Our vision to this platform is to have two different areas in mobile and desktop format: an area for organizations, where they can describe the cause it stands for, and promote actions/missions, that can be very diversified (volunteer after a natural disaster, crowdfunding, etc.). In this area, organizations will receive volunteer applications for its actions and rate their performance in those missions.

In other hand, we want an area for Employees, where they can recommend Organizations, search and activate notifications for meaningful missions, and apply as volunteer. 

So, join us in this new mission and help boost our efforts in building a better, fairer, and a more digital human World.
