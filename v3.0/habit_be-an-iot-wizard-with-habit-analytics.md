![Be an IoT Wizard with Habit Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/hackathon/master/v3.0/assets/habit_be-an-iot-wizard-with-habit-analytics.jpg "Be an IoT Wizard with Habit Analytics")

## Context

Habit Analytics provides an IoT platform, APIs and Mobile Applications to spark creativity in people and ease people‚Äôs lives. This means that DIY masters can use the platform to transform ‚ÄúDumb‚Äù devices into ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù remote controlled devices or automate their entire homes.
You don‚Äôt need to read this part, but... from a business perspective, Habit works with enterprise companies that want to enrich their services by connecting them with IoT. Examples of this are: dispatching emergency services that react to an IoT smoke detector, or a caregiver that will call a family member when a grandparents activity is out of the norm! We‚Äôre the tech behind these types of services, which also gives us a lot of space to play with cool stuff...

## Details

Ease someone‚Äôs life, home or your bat-cave ü¶á. 
What do we give you:
1. An IoT platform, its API‚Äôs and ready made mobile APPs
2. Access to listen in real-time the IoT data that results from the interaction of your mobile APP and your IoT device
3. Electronics and microcontrollers, in case you want to bring hardware into the scene! At your disposal a table full of ESP8266, raspberry-pis, arduinos and electronic kits. Please don‚Äôt ask us to install drivers on your old toshiba windows 95 computer or your new shiny macbook. We expect you to master it!
4. Workshops during Pixel‚Äôs camp to give you a boost on how the platform works. Calendar: March 22nd, 10:00AM and 2:00PM at Pixel‚Äôs camp. Find the Habit Dome!


What can you do:
1. Imagination is the key to this challenge, but we can give you some ideas:
Prank your coworker by turning off the light at a random number of seconds after he/she turns it on: Our platform, a microcontroller, and a couple of relays would do the trick!
2. Be nice to your grandmother and build her an irrigation system so she can spend her time preparing you cookies: A microcontroller and a water valve would be the key ingredients. 
3. Connect the weather service API to Habit‚Äôs and create ingenious automations with devices. 
4. Save the planet: Combine motion and light sensors and create awareness inside your company on how lights are efficiently being used.
5. Create the coolest pixel‚Äôs camp badge‚Ä¶ A remote controlled one? 
6. Integrate with a SMS/TEXT/CHAT API and allow others to control our Pixel camp‚Äôs Dome lights 
7. Be the perfect grandchild: Build a location tracker for your sporty driver grandma and surprise her every time she‚Äôs at the grocery store by being there to help carry her bags!

[Important] Please understand that our ideas are funny ways to describe different use cases around our platform. We don‚Äôt encourage anyone to build devices that can injury people, not respect laws or break any privacy right! Though, we do encourage you to be the coolest kid on the house! üòé
Show us your best idea and our team will be onsite to help you!


How to Apply
1. E-mail us to pixelscamp@habit.io with your name, github user id and your project idea so that we can share with you your API credentials 
2. Find a Habit team member at the BrightPixel Stand or Habit Dome to receive some hardware if necessary or to answer any questions that you may have.



Hardware available
This it totally optional and you don‚Äôt even need to touch hardware to build within the IoT World. Nevertheless, to the mighty warriors, we have several Raspberry Pi‚Äôs, breadboards and some electronic components that you can use to create your project. 

You may also have access to some third party IoT devices that will be at our Dome inside the chill-out area. 


Workshops
We want you to create the best project and win Pixel‚Äôs camp competition‚Ä¶ After all, life is IoT, right? :-)
Bootstrap your idea by attending our workshops happening on March 22nd at 10:00AM and 2:00PM inside Habit‚Äôs Dome at Pixel‚Äôs camp.
