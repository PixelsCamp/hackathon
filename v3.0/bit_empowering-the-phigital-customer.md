## Context

The shape of retail customer journeys is being disrupted by technology. Whether talking of eCommerce or physical stores there are several opportunities to improve these experiences. The jargons are omnichannel & digital transformation and we would like to focus on two dimensions: bringing some of the implicit benefits of eCommerce to the physical store (Autonomous Retail) and extend current digital services with other services that bring additional value to the table (Product Recognition and Augmented Basket).

## Details

Once again the Continente APIs are available so that catalogues, product information and many other services can serve as a foundational layer to support the prototypes and add a real feel to the content. In our stand you will also find an inspirational concept of a retail aisle where you will be able to find physical Continente products to scan.
 
**The challenges are:**

#### Autonomous Retail

Build a completely autonomous customer journey leveraging Contintente’s APIs from browsing catalogues to checkout enabling interactions with physical touchpoints as product scanning.
 
#### Product Recognition

Identify products that are in Continente’s product catalogue using information shared through Continente’s APIs and image recognition capabilities
 
#### Augmented Basket

Empower customers through a basket that is augmented with relevant information generated automatically as health indexes or recipes
 
Let’s do this!
