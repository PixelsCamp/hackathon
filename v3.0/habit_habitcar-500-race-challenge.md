## Context

There will be 5 RC race cars hidden in various locations around Pixel’s Camp starting at 10am on Thursday. Be one of the first 5 people or teams to find the car, connect it to Habit and get it up to speed so you can participate in the final race on Saturday afternoon. Use Habit to turn up the speed and control your car around the racetrack for the chance to win the “Grand Prix”. 

## Details

Bring your best scavenger hunting skills and find your car! There will be 5 cars hidden throughout the camp starting Thursday at 10am. Follow @habit_analytics on twitter for clues to finding the cars throughout the day. 

Once you’ve found your car, check inside for clues on how to start connecting the car to the Habit platform. Visit the Habit Dome on Friday for more tips and tools to get you up and running. 

We will be hosting workshops on Friday at 10am and 2pm where you can learn more about integrating with our platform and get new ideas on how to really pimp up your ride. 

Saturday at noon: it’s off to the races!! “Drive” your car over to the Habit Dome and be prepared to burn some rubber on the racetrack. First car to win the race will win the Grand Prix Trophy and be eligible for the Habit Pixels camp prize. 

Any questions? E-mail us at pixelscamp@habit.io or tweet us @habit_analytics 

PS: If you don’t find a car but still want to build something cool, you can always participate in our IoT Wizard Challenge. And don’t forget to visit us at the Habit Dome in the “Chill Out Area”.
