## Portal Challenges

![Portal Challenges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/hackathon/master/v3.0/assets/nos-empresas_portal-challenges.jpg "Portal Challenges")

## Context

At NOS we developed a Tourism Information Portal that contains a descriptive analysis of the characterization and mobility of the Tourists. We are aware that the visualization of information, graphics and infographics, are increasingly important to present data in an intelligible way for anyone to understand. Also, we increasingly want to have a more relevant digital presence and initiate conversations with our clients to show the potential of the Tourist Information Portal, clarify doubts and continuously improve information on tourism-related Analytics.

## Details

**Choose one of the following, or both, in case you believe you can do it:**

#### a) Dataviz

Details: Are you ready to take our portal to the next level? That’s right, we challenge you to look into our Tourism Information Portal (http://www.nos.pt/portalturismo) and revamp it anyway you like to make it look better, by building a new one. Wow us with your Data Visualization capabilities and become the next Mike Bostock.
 
#### b) BOT/ NLP

Details: Here we challenge you to create a bot for the Tourism Information Portal (http://www.nos.pt/portalturismo) to enable a visitor to search for any of its content but also suggest different insights or rearrange display of insights based on previous interactions, and offer “did you know?” tips, as well as when the commercial team would be available to meet (sharing the email invite right after the visitor sharing its contact, if enterprise), etc.
