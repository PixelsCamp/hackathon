## Stock controller for supermarkets

![Stock controller for supermarkets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PixelsCamp/hackathon/master/v3.0/assets/nos-empresas_stock-controller-for-supermarkets.jpg "Stock controller for supermarkets")

## Context

Proof of Concept for a solution that controls stock in shelves of supermarkets in real time. 

Advanced video analytics are one of the potential approaches for that but need to be proved.

## Details

#### Briefing

Supermarkets need to constantly control their stock availability on shelves, for replacement purposes. The main challenge here is that every time a product is out of stock, employees reorganize the products position again so there are no blank spaces. Because of that, there is no strict position allocated to any product. The purpose of this challenge is to find a technical solution that identifies products out of stock, allowing an efficient replacement process, having in mind the restrictions presented bellow. 

#### Similar solutions

Currently, there are no commercial solutions available in the market although some pilots are being driven by some specific customers trying to find out a proper solution.

#### Conditions / Restrictions

1) The technology must be financially feasible.

2) The technology should not require fitting much wiring in the location to be installed. 

3) The technology must comply with the privacy standards and GPDR. 

4) The ability to detect the amount of stock on the shelves will be valued.  

#### Example of use

The stock replenishment team at a supermarket is responsible to guarantee the products availability in shelves. There must be no products out of stock, in between the thousands of items they have. For that reason, they would like to receive notifications whenever there is an out of stock, indicating the correspondent product and shelf.

#### Expected result

1st step – Present the user journey

2nd step – Present a functional PoC of the suggested approach

3rd step – Present a UX and technology advantages of the solution.
